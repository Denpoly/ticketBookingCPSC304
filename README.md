# SQLDump
There is a sqlDump file, run this script in your MySQL manager to create the tables and prepopulate them.

# Components 
Components go inside the view package. Look at the selectPanel for an example. <br>


# Queries
New Queries go inside the MySqlConnection static class (in "utils/MySqlConnection"). Create a static method representing the query so that an object class does not have to be instantiated

# Console Element
There is a console element in our jFrame for the UI. Anything that is System.out.println() will be outputted in that console element. This is to make it easier to display query results
